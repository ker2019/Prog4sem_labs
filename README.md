# Computer technologies in MIPT --- Part 1
Computer technologies is the course told in the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Aim of the course is some practice in numerical analysis with such tools as gmsh, vtk and fenics. This repository is created for the laboratory works at the first stage of the course.

## Laboratory work 1: gmsh

Here we are to build torus using the Gmsh library and mesh it. Also we are to mesh some STL module and make beautiful picture. As the STL
model I used "heart pendant".

## Laboratory work 2: vtk

We should define a velocity field on the model meshed in the previous lab and using get a video of its motion.

## Laboratory work 3: fenics

Numerical solution to the wave equation using the Fenics.
